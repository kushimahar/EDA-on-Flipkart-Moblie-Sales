# EDA-on-Flipkart-Moblie-Sales
# JUXTAPOSITION:

Flipkart Private Limited is an e-commerce company based in India that was founded in 2007. It began with a focus on online book sales and quickly evolved to include lifestyle products, electronics, household needs, and groceries. Flipkart is now India's largest online marketplace, competing with Amazon, the world's largest.
Letsbuy, Myntra, Jabong, eBay India, and more companies have been acquired by the firm since 2010. Flipkart has branches in Delhi and Mumbai in addition to its headquarters in Bengaluru. The company is registered in Singapore in addition to India. Walmart, a US-based retailer, bought a controlling share in Flipkart in 2018. Beyond what data analysts gain via modelling and hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is what data analysts perform with enormous volumes of data, looking for patterns and summarising the dataset's major characteristics. EDA is a data-analytics concept that allows analysts to approach a database without making assumptions.

Linear regression analysis is a statistical technique for predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another. The dependent variable is the variable you want to forecast. The independent variable is the one you're using to forecast the value of the other variable.
This type of analysis involves one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable in order to estimate the coefficients of the linear equation. Linear regression creates a straight line or surface that reduces the difference between expected and actual output values. Simple linear regression calculators that employ the "least squares" method to get the best-fit line for a set of paired data are available. You then use Y to calculate the value of X (dependent variable) (independent variable).

# OBJECTIVE:
1.In this project, we perform EDA to analyse and understand a set of Flipkart mobile products.
2. To fit a Linear regression model to predict the sales price.

# CONCLUSION:
The EDA on the considered data set shows that Samsung and Apple are the two major brands effecting the sales price on the bases of various other factors. The linear regression model is built to predict the sales price of the mobile products, giving a large error value where MAE,MSE and RMSE are 9087.51, 142435754.33 and 11934.65 respectively, showing that this model is not a good fit.
This concludes that various other machine learning models will be required to reduce the error and build a good fit model.
